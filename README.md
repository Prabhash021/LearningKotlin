# startingKotlin
  I am starting to learn Kotlin from basics. It will contain Day to Day update of my progress, I might be slow, but I will try to be consistent.

### Day1:
  - Variable, Data Type, if-else, when, loop, array   
### Day2:
 - Val and Var in array, difference b/w char and string, operation on string, repeat, all about function
